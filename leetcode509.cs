QUESTION: 509. Fibonacci Number

DESCRIPTION:
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the
Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

Given n, calculate F(n).
